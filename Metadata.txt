This repository contains a table (see the file all_data_sources.xlsx) with all information necessary to obtain the raw data. This table, combined with the detailed data processing steps below, allows the reader to reproduce the research. We provide sources to obtain occurrence records, pesticide application data, climate data (maximum surface temperature and precipitation), land use change data, and the phylogenetic tree used for this work. All data were freely available from providers. 

We used R statistical software to prepare the raw dataset of North American Odonata occurrence records. After combining the species records that originated from the different sources, we removed inadequate records, including those with incomplete information for species identification, year, or locality, inaccurate georeferenced points, and duplicate records. Two species names were updated in the raw data. We changed the name Tetragoneuria canis to Epitheca canis, and Tetragoneuria cynosura to Epitheca cynosura in our dataset. We limited the study extent to the continental United States of America (USA) and extracted species records sampled between 1980 and 2018. A column was added to the main data table to identify the time period of each record, where the historical time period corresponds to years 1980 to 2002, and the most recent time period to years 2008 to 2018 inclusively. We also estimated the distance from the equator of each record using the distGeo function from the R package Geosphere. Species√ï range limits were calculated using the mean of the five most northern points per time period. The difference in range limits between the two time periods was assigned to each species in a separate table to show range shifts. The main data table contained the following columns: species' scientific name, the time period in which it was collected, latitude and longitude, and the date of collection for each record. 

To measure species persistence per quadrat (100 X 100 km), we first created a fishnet using ArcGIS version 10.8 and the Albers Equal Area projection as a shapefile. The shapefile is available in this repository. We assigned a quadrat identification number to each observation according to the latitude and longitude of the record. The persistence metric was set to a value of 1 if a species remained present in the second time period, or to a value of 0 if a species declined in the most recent time period. Careful criteria were applied to further filter the data. We extracted species found in at least 100 quadrats, and quadrats that contained a minimum of 15 species observed. With the Chao index for species richness estimation from the R vegan package, we estimated the number of species present per quadrat and only kept those with a maximum of 15 species between the observed and predicted number of species found. Finally, we selected quadrats with a difference of -8 to +8 species observations in the second time period compared to the first to minimize effects of sampling intensity change.

Pesticide application data was available in text format. Low estimates were incomplete for years 2010 to 2018, so we used high estimates. We calculated the mean of the yearly sum of the various pesticide types per US county and measured the difference between both time period. Using the provided county FIPS code and an ArcGIS base map of all US counties, we saved pesticide change per county as a shapefile. We then used the fishnet shapefile to extract the mean pesticide change value per quadrat with the extract function of the R raster package.

The climate and land use data were downloaded in raster format. Using the stack function from the raster R package we combined the layers for each time period and variable to calculate the mean across both time periods and the difference in climate between the recent and historical time period. We used the 100 X 100km fishnet shapefile to extract the mean temperature and precipitation change value per quadrat.
